########## TODO

##  Add benchmark information, potentially from several solvers.

########## Potential speed improvements

##  Add issymmetric && Symmetric to speed up certain cases in ScatteredInterpolation

##  Options to solve ScatteredInterpolation linear eq system on gpu.

##  Use iterative solver on cpu with a larger tolerance. Test if keeping 
    the optimum settings from the previous iteration and using them as a seed
    improve convergence speed for the iterative solver. 

##  Possibility to save entire optimization state in an easy manner. 

##  Try optimizing widths by optimizing a subset before optimizing the entire range.

##  Implement RBFs with sparse support to increase speed of solving linear eq. system.

########## Wishlist

##  Fancy results printing

##  More verbosity levels of printing with better formatting

##  Call and continue optimisation with the results type.

##  Documentation with PlotlyJS web based plots for easy viewing of different options.
